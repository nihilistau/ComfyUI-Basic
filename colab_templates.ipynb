    "\n",
    "- A concise, Colab-focused roadmap (milestones + success criteria).\n",
    "- Small, safe example cells you can run in Colab or locally to bootstrap work: DRIVE mount + `DRIVE_ROOT` setup, `compose_flow` demo, `preview_url` dry-run, and a `queue` demo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Milestones:\n",
    "1. Stabilize developer onboarding: reliable DRIVE_ROOT detection and minimal example flows (this notebook).\n",
    "2. Add small unit-tests for `composer.compose_flow` and `queue` operations (CI-friendly).\n",
    "3. Provide polished notebook README + troubleshooting for Colab/Drive mounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Success criteria:\n",
    "- A newcomer can open this notebook, run the first 3 cells, and create a flow JSON under Drive.\n",
    "- Examples are safe (no large downloads or secrets) and demonstrate the standard import pattern for `Helper Scipts` modules."
